<p> Cacao has a long history in Costa Rica. The beans were originally used as currency by indigenous tribes in Pre-Columbian times, and continued to be a form of currency up until the 1930s. Growing and harvesting cacao was one of the country's major industries before the introduction of coffee in the late 1700s outpaced it. Cacao remained an important export in Costa Rica until a fungus blight swept through the plantations in 1979, drastically reducing cacao production by 95%. </p> 
<p> As dark chocolate increases in popularity, larger chocolate manufacturers are increasingly interested in these farmer's wonderful beans. There's a potential to bring back a way of life that is good for all involved, not exploitative or damaging to the environment. Within 5 to 10 years, when the trees are productive, Costa Rica is going to be a hot market for cacao. What the farmers and their families do now will set the stage for better lives for their children and a strong new tradition of cacao.</p>

<p> The crop is grown in Ivory Coast mostly by smallholder farmers planting on 1-3 hectares.The pods containing the beans are harvested when a sufficient number are ripe, opened to separate the seeds and pulp from the outer rind, and the seeds and pulp are usually allowed to ferment somewhere on the farm, before the seeds are dried in a central location. The dried seeds are purchased by a traitant or buyer who, travels among villages in an area to weigh, purchase and collect the crop.</p>
