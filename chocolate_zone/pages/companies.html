<p>

Cadbury was founded nearly 200 years ago, and is now one of the biggest and best chocolate brands on the market. Cadbury was the first chocolatier to create milk chocolate. In 1857, Daniel Peter, a Swiss Manufacturer, added milk to his recipe to create the world's first milk chocolate. However, the first Cadbury milk chocolate bar didn't hit shelves until 1897.The heart shape chocolate box is all thanks to Cadbury, as Richard Cadbury, the son of Cadbury founder, John Cadbury, came up with the idea in 1861 for Valentine's Day.

Cadbury once owned the colour purple. Well, a particular shade of purple, that is. No other chocolate company could use Pantone 2685c, which is famously used in the Dairy Milk packaging.

From time to time, various special and limited edition flavours are released, sometimes with seasonal themes. For example, Marc de Champagne contained a truffle-like center with a champagne flavour and 'Yogurt ai Frutti di Bosco' contained a punchy sour berry center to complement the sweet milk chocolate. Three limited edition flavoured bars are released each season; the two most successful flavours are carried on to the next year's seasonal release, while the third flavour is something new.
